# S4NDrones

This project uses the Gradle build system. With Gradle's [Application plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/application_plugin.html) it creates a Java executable.

There's an accompanying video that explains the architecture, you should have received a copy, if not, write me an email asking for it.
